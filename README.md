# AmiusAdventure
A cross platform furry RPG game similar to the Mario &amp; Luigi series games

## Licensing
The entire project as the sum of its parts and all code in all folders besides the [n3ds_platform](n3ds_platform/) folder is licensed under GPLv3. I have licensed the contents of [n3ds_platform](n3ds_platform/) folder as MIT because writing code for the 3DS is hard due to poor documentation (Or maybe I didn't look hard enough and Phind AI is dumb). This is so anyone who wishes to make their own 3ds game can use my code as foundation to work off of.

## Cross-Platform Design
I'm making the game engine ([amius_adventure](amius_adventure/)) and hardware routines (any folder that ends in "_platform") seperate so that the game can be as portable as possible,
right now I plan on making a Nintendo 3DS version and PC Version (Win/Mac/Linux) of the game.

If you want to see the game ported to another platform, feel free to make a feature request for it. Or if you're feeling adventurous you can check out [PORTING.md](PORTING.md) to see how you could port the game yourself.
